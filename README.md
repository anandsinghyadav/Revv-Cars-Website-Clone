Construct Week: Unit-2 Masai School
Hi Guys, I will be sharing our experience of Project in “MASAI SCHOOL” unit 2 construct week. we have given a Project to clone the website of Revv website in our final week of unit 2. In this project, we are a team of 4 members Anand Singh Yadav, Haresh Solanki, Mahendra Singh, and Yashasvi Srivastava.

ABOUT: REVV WEBSITE (Revv Self Drive Cars)
Revv is a self-drive car rental service that provides you with all the privacy, fun, and convenience of your own car, without the hassles of owning and maintaining one. We drop and pick up cars from your doorstep so that you can spend time on the more important thing — your drive! The doorstep drop and pick-up of cars is our standard way of serving you and is available throughout the areas served by us.

EXPERIENCE
We are a team of 4 members, we had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new stuff while cloning our website. We have gone through various issues while creating the clone website. But we were happy when everything got fixed in its place like pieces puzzle. There were a few issues we faced during this period. But in the end, we were happy with the outcome of our hard work.

PLATFORMS THAT WE HAD USED FOR COMMUNICATION
As we were working remotely, Slack and Zoom was the only app that helped us communicate with our teammates. We also used GitHub for creating and pushing our files and creating milestones. We had a fixed schedule by which we had to complete the given task for the day and at the end of each day, we have to show our progress to each other through zoom meetings. This was very helpful as we were able to decide how much we have covered as a team and what are changes required to make the page work properly.

ISSUES THAT WE HAD FACED DURING THE BUILD WEEK
There were a few minor issues that we had during our projects building. However, we were able to fix those issues. Thanks to our team and our instructor Chandra sir and our IA Anmol sir.
